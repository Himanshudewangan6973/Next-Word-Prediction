# Next-Word-Prediction
## Abstract
Next-word prediction, also called language modeling, is one field of natural language processing as it can improve the efficiency and accuracy of language input systems by predicting the next word. One approach to next-word prediction is to use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a recurrent neural network (RNN) type that can model long-term dependencies in sequential data. In this word prediction project, we are using Bi-LSTM.

## Technologies and libraries used:
Pandas, Numpy, TensorFlow, Keras, Tokenizer, LSTM (Long-Short-Term-Memory), Bidirectional, Adam
